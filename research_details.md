# Detailed Research Information

## PhD Research: Deep Learning Based Prognosis and Explainability for Breast Cancer

### Research Objectives
1. Develop novel deep learning architectures for breast cancer survival prediction
2. Create explainable AI models that clinicians can trust and understand
3. Integrate multimodal data (histopathology images, genomics, clinical data)
4. Build treatment recommendation systems based on patient-specific factors

### Key Innovations
- **BioFusionNet**: A multimodal fusion network that combines histopathology images with genomic and clinical data for survival risk stratification
- **hist2RNA**: An efficient architecture that predicts gene expression directly from histopathology images
- **AFExNet**: An adversarial autoencoder for cancer subtype classification and biomarker discovery

### Technical Approach
- Utilizes attention mechanisms for interpretability
